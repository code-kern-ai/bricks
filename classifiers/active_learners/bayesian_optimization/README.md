This is a bayesian optimised active learner. When we deal with significantly small hypervolume in a given n dimensional search space, random search needs very large number of samples, which can be very expensive. Bayesian optimisation is a sample efficient alternative for algorithmic assurance. With the use of gaussian process regression, B.O. calculates the best hyperparameters that globally optimises a black box function. Note that this might take a few minutes to run.
