Computes the complexity of a sentence using the Flesch-ease reading ease formula.The formula is as follows: Flesch Reading Ease = 206.835 – (1.015 x Average Sentence Length) – (84.6 x Average Syllables Per Word). The higher the score, the easier the content is to read and understand. Average sentence length can be calculated by dividing the number of words by the number of sentences
The score is categorized, where 0 is the most difficult and 122 is the easiest. The coefficients used in the formula were chosen to match a scale where a very easy text has a score of 100 and a really difficult one has a score of 02. The coefficients were determined through trial and error to best fit the data available at the time It can be used to compare the complexity of different texts.
