Languages can be very dynamic and complicated. This brick does not actually try to be able to accurately classify all sentences, which would be quite complex. Instead, this brick is meant to check if some characteristics apply that a lot of complete sentences have. These characteristics being: does the sentence starts with an uppercase character, if it ends on a punctuation and if it contains at least two nouns and a verb. The name `starts_with_uppercase_ends_with_punctuation_and_contains_two_nouns_and_a_verb` would be a bit long for a brick, though.
