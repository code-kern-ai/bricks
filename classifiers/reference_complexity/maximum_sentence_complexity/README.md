This is similar to the standard sentence complexity brick, with the difference that this brick returns the highest sentence complexity found in a text. The formula for calculating the complexity is as follows: Flesch Reading Ease = 206.835 – (1.015 x Average Sentence Length) – (84.6 x Average Syllables Per Word). The higher the score, the easier the content is to read and understand. Average sentence length can be calculated by dividing the number of words by the number of sentences
The score is categorized, where 0 is the most difficult and 122 is the easiest. The coefficients used in the formula were chosen to match a scale where a very easy text has a score of 100 and a really difficult one has a score of 2. The coefficients were determined through trial and error to best fit the data available at the time.
