VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool. It's specifically tuned to get the sentiment of social-media post, but also works on other text-types as well. This version returns a string with either "positive", "neutral" or "negative". See the generators section for "vader sentiment scores" to get a brick that only returns the scores. Learn more here: https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment
