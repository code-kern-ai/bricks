Uses OpenAI's GPT models as a cross encoder for relevancy classification. In a nutshell, both a user-question as well as a retrieved reference are passed to the GPT model with the instruction to rate the reference-relevancy on a scale from 0 to 100. If the score is higher that 50, the reference is classified as relevant. This brick is also compatible with the Azure OpenAI service.
