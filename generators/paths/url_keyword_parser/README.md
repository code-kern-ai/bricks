Extracts keywords from URLs using regex and NLTK. There are multiple configurations you can set. INCLUDE_DOMAIN tries to extract keywords from the domain (e.g. "google.com") as well. If INCLUDE_PARAMETER is set to true, we do the same with all remaining parts of the URL (params, query & fragment of `urlparse`).  CHECK_VALID_URL allows you to check if a URL is valid or not. With REMOVE_NONE_ENGLISH and REMOVE_STOPWORDS you can opt to remove non-english words or stop-words provided by nltk. Setting REMOVE_HEX_LIKE to true remove any hex numbers in the URL. With TEXT_SEPERATOR you can set the separator for the final text and SPLIT_REGEX allows you to add any possible regex for splitting the URL. If you want to whitelist words you can do so by adding them to WORD_WHITE_LIST.
