This module is useful if the text is too huge to read. It provides a short summary for the input text. The module uses spacy in order to tokenize the sentences and calculate scores based on the frequency of the tokenized words. The basic idea is that the sentences containing words that have the highest frequency score are assumed to be important. The summary is constructed out of the most important sentences.
