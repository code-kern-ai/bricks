This brick module is using the sumy library from GitHub to summarize texts that were scraped from websites like wikipedia or blog articles. The function excepts an url to a website and not a text itself. It uses Latent Semantic Analysis to extract structures of the words and texts used to find relevant sentences. You can read more about the sumy libraray here: https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy
