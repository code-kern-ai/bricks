This brick module is using the sumy library from GitHub to summarize texts from websites like wikipedia or blog articles. The articles are scraped via sumy as well, so an internet connection is needed. The function excepts an url to a website and not a text itself. It uses Latent Semantic Analysis to extract structures of the words and texts used to find relevant sentences. You can read more about the sumy libraray here: https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy
