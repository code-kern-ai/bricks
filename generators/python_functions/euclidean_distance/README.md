Calculates the euclidean distance between two vectors of text embeddings, which are created by a tf-idf vectorizer. The longer the texts are, the more accurate the results should be. The euclidean distance can be used to determine the similarity between to vectors. Please keep in mind that the optimal distance metric always depends on your use-case. For an alternative use the cosine-similarity.
