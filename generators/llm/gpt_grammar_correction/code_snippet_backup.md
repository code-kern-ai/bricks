    Uses OpenAIs GPT-3 model to classify texts. Visit https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create for full documentation 

    OpenAI parameters: 
    - temperature: Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer.

    - max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.

    - top_p: Amount of tokens the model considers.

    - frequency_penalty: Value between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

    - presence_penalty: Value between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
