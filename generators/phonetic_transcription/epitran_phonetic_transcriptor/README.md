This epitran-based phonetic transcriptor generates phonetic transcriptions of words in a given text. Additionally, it utilizes the CEDICT dictionary database, which provides English definitions for Chinese characters, and the jieba tokenizer for the Chinese language.

- CEDICT: Comprehensive English-Chinese dictionary database. Link: https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict
- Jieba: Chinese text segmentation tool. Link: https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba

Usage:
To generate phonetic transcriptions, provide the text and a language code in the format of ISO 639-3 language codes and ISO 15924 script codes (e.g., "eng-Latn").
