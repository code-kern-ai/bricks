Calculates the euclidean distance between two vectors of text embeddings, which are created by a tf-idf vectorizer. The longer the texts are, the more accurate the results should be. The euclidean distance can be used to determine the similarity between two vectors. Please keep in mind that the optimal distance metric always depends on your use-case. For an alternative use the cosine-similarity.

The difference between the code in `code_snippet_refinery.md` and `code_snippet_common.md` is, that the common code returns a matrix of all the similarities, while the refinery code returns only individual values based on a base sentence. This is because the refinery code cannot (yet) access all the data at the same time. Please also note that refinery also calculates the cosine similarity between all texts based on the transformer embeddings in the vector database by default.
