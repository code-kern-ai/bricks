Calculates the hamming distance between vector representations of two strings. The hamming distance is the proportion of disagreeing components in two vectors, 1.0 being very dissimilar and 0.0 meaning completely the same. This modules returns a `float` value for hamming distance.

The difference between the code in `code_snippet_refinery.md` and `code_snippet_common.md` is, that the common code returns a matrix of all the similarities, while the refinery code returns only individual values based on a base sentence. This is because the refinery code cannot (yet) access all the data at the same time. Please also note that refinery also calculates the cosine similarity between all texts based on the transformer embeddings in the vector database by default.
