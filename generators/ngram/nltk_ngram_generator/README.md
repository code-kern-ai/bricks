This nltk-based n-gram generator allows to generate word n-grams from a given input sentence. Utilizes the spaCy tokenizer for tokenization. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of 'n' words from a text. For example, in the sentence "The quick brown fox", the 2-grams (bigrams) are "The quick" and "quick brown", and "brown fox". 
Users can specify the size of the n-grams, ranging from bigrams (2-grams) to n-grams of any size, as well as spaCy language model (default is en_core_web_sm).
