Important: Currently, it's not possible to store audiofiles directly in Kern AI refinery. How this brick works is by accessing .wav files that are stored remotely, for example is an S3 bucket, a Google Drive and so on. All you need to provide is a valid link to access the file. As this module uses an Azure service, you would also need an active Azure subscription as well as an API key to Azures Cognitive Services. For the region parameter, please provide the region name that your Azure resource is deployed in (for example "northeurope" or "westus"). See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/search-apis/bing-news-search/reference/market-codes) for a full list of all available languages. Please contact the Kern AI Team if you need and API key or further support at info@kern.ai or join our Discord channel: https://discord.gg/WAnAgQEv
