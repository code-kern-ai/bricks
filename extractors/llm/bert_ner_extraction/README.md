Uses a BERT transformer model that is accessed via the HuggingFace Inference API for Named Entity Recognition (NER). Recognizes for entities: location (LOC), organizations (ORG), person (PER) and Miscellaneous (MISC). The upside of using this over SpaCy is that the BERT model is much more accurate and less prone to do errors. Requires an API key from HuggingFace, which you can get by signing up on HuggingFace.
