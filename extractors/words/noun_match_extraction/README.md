The function uses the spacy library to load an English language model and process the input text. It then extracts noun chunks from the processed text and iterates over them. For each noun chunk, if it has more than one word, the first word is taken as the target word. If the target word has not been used before, it is added to a repository to avoid duplicate use and a regular expression pattern is created with the target word. The function then uses this pattern to find all matches in the input text and extracts their spans. Finally, the function returns a list of tuples containing the noun match positions.
